# EU Identity Responsibility Infrastructure (IPR)
## Technical Positioning — EU Aligned

### Definition
IPR (Identity Primary Record) is a digital infrastructure for verifiable attribution and responsibility designed for high-compliance EU environments.

Its function is to establish a verifiable link between identity, action, responsibility and time without centralized custody of personal data.

Core properties:
- data-minimal
- hash-based
- append-only
- audit-ready
- interoperable

IPR does not replace national identity systems or eIDAS frameworks.  
It operates as an additional attribution and responsibility layer above existing systems.

---

### What it is not
IPR is not:
- a cryptocurrency
- a social scoring system
- a surveillance database
- a belief-based system
- a centralized identity registry

IPR does not require ideological, political or religious classification.  
It is a neutral technical attribution layer.

---

### Problem addressed
Current digital systems suffer from an attribution gap:

difficulty linking in an opposable way:
- identity
- action
- responsibility
- time

This generates:
- legal ambiguity
- fraud exposure
- audit complexity
- compliance costs
- trust fragmentation

IPR introduces a verifiable ex-ante attribution and an audit-ready ex-post trace.

---

### Risk and cost reduction
IPR reduces:
- identity ambiguity
- delegation opacity
- non-opposable actions
- verification overhead

IPR increases:
- responsibility clarity
- traceability
- audit efficiency
- cross-system trust

---

### EU compatibility
Designed according to:

**GDPR principles**
- data minimization
- no central data custody
- hash-based verification
- privacy-by-architecture

**eIDAS 2.0 compatibility**
- interoperable with EU digital identity wallets
- verifiable attributes ready
- cross-border usage compatible

**Zero-trust alignment**
- no implicit trust
- continuous verification
- append-only traceability

---

### Abstract architecture
Layers:

1. Identity anchor  
   link to verified identity (external or sovereign)

2. Responsibility layer  
   attribution of decision/action

3. Trace layer  
   append-only hash registration

4. Verification layer  
   public verification without exposing personal data

5. Interoperability layer  
   API and modular integration

No mandatory central database.  
Federated and modular architecture.

### Priority EU use cases

**B2B and supply chain**
- contractual attribution
- audit traceability
- liability clarity

**AI and robotics**
- human-machine responsibility binding
- decision traceability
- operational audit

**Critical infrastructures**
- energy
- mobility
- space
- industrial systems

**Digital governance**
- verifiable operational identity
- opposable signatures
- decision traceability

---

### EU-first positioning
The European Union provides the optimal regulatory and technological environment for deployment due to:

- advanced identity regulation
- strong privacy frameworks
- cross-border interoperability needs
- digital sovereignty strategy

IPR positions itself as a neutral European-aligned responsibility infrastructure layer.

---

### Status
Current stage:
- modular architecture development
- EU alignment phase
- pilot preparation
- audit-first design

Approach:
fail-closed · audit-ready · EU-aligned · data-minimal

---

### Objective
Enable individuals, organizations, institutions and AI systems to operate with:

verifiable attribution  
clear responsibility  
auditable temporal trace  

within European and global digital environments.
