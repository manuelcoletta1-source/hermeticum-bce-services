# HERMETICUM B.C.E. — INSTITUTION
**European Platform for Verifiable Digital Proof and Identity Continuity**

Hermeticum B.C.E. is a **UE-first digital platform** designed to support
**independent verification, integrity assessment and time-based opponibility**
of digital identity records and related evidence.

The platform is intended for use by
**public institutions, regulators and judicial authorities**
as a **neutral technical instrument of verification**.

---

## Institutional Purpose

Digital evidence and identity records often suffer from:
- disputed timestamps
- uncertain integrity
- dependency on private or centralized systems
- lack of long-term verifiability

Hermeticum B.C.E. addresses these issues by providing
a platform that enables **technical proof independent from the parties involved**.

---

## Platform Function

Hermeticum B.C.E. does **not** issue legal decisions.
It does **not** interpret law.
It does **not** enforce outcomes.

Its sole function is to:
- enable verification of integrity
- provide reproducible proof of existence at a given time
- support auditability and opponibility of digital records

---

## Verification Capabilities

The platform enables institutions to:
- verify that a digital record has not been altered
- verify that a record existed at a specific point in time
- reproduce verification independently
- audit the verification process

Verification does not require trust in a single operator or vendor.

---

## Identity Primary Record (IPR)

Hermeticum B.C.E. relies on the concept of an
**Identity Primary Record (IPR)**:

- a technical record representing identity-related data
- cryptographically verifiable
- time-anchored through public mechanisms
- separable from personal data storage

The IPR functions as a **technical reference**, not as a legal identity issuer.

---

## Opponibility and Time Anchoring

The platform supports:
- public time anchoring
- integrity proof through cryptographic equivalence
- long-term reproducibility of verification

These properties enable **technical opponibility**
in administrative and judicial contexts.

---

## Governance and Neutrality

Hermeticum B.C.E. is designed according to the following principles:
- technological neutrality
- separation of data, proof and governance
- non-dependence on a single ledger or authority
- auditability by design

The platform is compatible with **European regulatory frameworks**
and intended to complement existing identity and evidence systems.

---

## Institutional Boundaries

Hermeticum B.C.E. is:
- not a certification authority
- not a legal registry
- not a decision-making system
- not a replacement for public institutions

It provides **technical verification**, not legal authority.

---

## Ecosystem Role

This repository documents the **institutional access domain**
of the Hermeticum B.C.E. platform.

Operational and technical components are maintained separately
and integrated through the platform control layer.

---

## Status

Institutional access: **available**  
Audit and verification focus: **active**  
Regulatory alignment: **UE-first**
