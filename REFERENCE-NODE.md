# European Responsibility Infrastructure
## Reference Node Declaration

Status: ACTIVE  
Type: Public technical reference implementation  
Jurisdiction: EU-aligned  
Mode: Permissionless  

---

## Nature

This node represents a live reference implementation of a
responsibility attribution infrastructure based on the IPR model.

It is not a commercial platform.
It is not a centralized service.
It operates as a technical reference environment.

---

## Function

Provides observable implementation of:

- IPR activation
- deterministic verification
- ex-ante attribution model
- append-only registry
- metrological execution precondition logic

All processes are publicly inspectable.

---

## Position

This node exists as a technical reference for:

research  
audit observation  
experimental adoption  
future standardization contexts  

No authorization required for replication.

---

## Independence

The infrastructure model does not depend on this node.
Any compatible implementation may exist independently.

Persistence of one valid node is sufficient
for model continuity.

---

## Status

Operational  
Publicly accessible  
Append-only evolution
