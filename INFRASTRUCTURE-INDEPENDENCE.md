# Infrastructure Independence Statement

The IPR responsibility infrastructure is designed
to operate without dependence on a central authority.

It may be replicated, implemented, modified and deployed
by any entity following the minimal technical standard.

No single operator controls the network.
No authorization is required to implement a node.
Verification remains local and deterministic.

The infrastructure persists as long as at least one valid node exists.

This document defines an engineering property,
not a political claim.
