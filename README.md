# HERMETICUM B.C.E. PLATFORM
**European Platform for Verifiable Digital Identity and Proof in Time**

Hermeticum B.C.E. is a **UE-first digital platform** providing
**verifiable identity, integrity and legally opposable proof over time**
for citizens, professionals and public institutions.

The platform operates as a **control and access layer**
that enables long-term validity, auditability and interoperability
across digital identity systems.

---

## Platform Objective

Digital identity systems often lack:
- continuity over time
- independent verification
- legal opponibility across jurisdictions

Hermeticum B.C.E. addresses these limitations by introducing
a platform that ensures:
- integrity of identity-related data
- public and verifiable time anchoring
- reproducible audit and verification processes

The platform **does not replace** existing identity solutions.
It **extends them with a higher layer of proof and coherence**.

---

## Platform Role

Hermeticum B.C.E. is **not an application** and **not a single service**.

It functions as a **platform layer** that:
- coordinates identity records (IPR)
- separates data from proof mechanisms
- enables independent verification
- supports UE-first governance and audit requirements

---

## Access Domains

The platform exposes **three clearly separated access domains**.

### Citizen (EU)
For individuals requiring:
- a verifiable digital identity
- protection of documents and credentials over time
- continuity across countries and legal contexts

The citizen domain abstracts all technical complexity.

---

### Professional / Technical
For engineers, enterprises and legal-tech operators.

Provides access to:
- platform architecture
- identity record structure (IPR)
- verification and audit workflows
- integration interfaces

This domain enables technical validation and system integration.

---

### Institution / Tribunal
For public administrations, regulators and judicial authorities.

Focused on:
- integrity verification
- timestamp opponibility
- audit traceability
- technological neutrality

The platform acts as a **neutral verification instrument**.
It does not interpret, decide or enforce outcomes.

---

## Core Principles

- **UE-first design** aligned with European regulatory frameworks
- **Separation of concerns** between data, proof and governance
- **Auditability** through reproducible verification
- **Technology neutrality** and non-dependence on single vendors
- **Long-term validity** of identity and proof

---

## Platform Boundaries

Hermeticum B.C.E. is:
- not a social platform
- not a financial system
- not a proprietary identity silo
- not an autonomous decision-maker

Its sole function is to provide **verifiable proof and continuity**.

---

## Ecosystem Context

This repository represents the **Platform Control Plane**.

Operational components (identity, verification, governance, intelligence)
are maintained in dedicated repositories and integrated through
the platform layer.

---

## Status

Platform architecture: **stable**  
Refactoring focus: **platform-first orientation**  
Development state: **active**
