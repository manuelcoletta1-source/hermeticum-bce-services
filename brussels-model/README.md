# HERMETICUM — Brussels Model

This package provides a systemic, technical and economic assessment of the
structural decay affecting the European Union digital and administrative
architecture.

The model quantifies the cost generated by the absence of a shared technical
layer capable of verifying the temporal origin of acts and data before their
institutional recognition.

Estimated cumulative decay impact (EU-27, 10–15 year horizon):
≈ €1,000,000,000,000

This package is non-political, non-sovereign, audit-oriented and EU-first.
