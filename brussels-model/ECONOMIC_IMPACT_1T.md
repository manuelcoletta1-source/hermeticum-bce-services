# Economic Impact Assessment — €1 Trillion Decay

Scope:
EU-27, public and private sectors, 10–15 year horizon.

Conservative annual impact estimates:

1. Regulatory and enforcement inefficiency (DMA, DSA, AI Act):
   €25–30B

2. Legal disputes and administrative duplication:
   €20–25B

3. Data governance and digital market friction (Data Act, interoperability):
   €30–40B

4. Cybersecurity and hybrid threat response (ex-post handling):
   €15–20B

Estimated annual systemic loss:
€90–115B

Projected cumulative loss over 10–15 years (non-linear compounding):
≈ €900B – €1.2T

Reference rounded value:
≈ €1 Trillion

This represents value lost due to missing infrastructure, not direct spending.
