# Systemic Decay Model — European Union

Systemic decay is defined as the cumulative loss generated by the absence of a
verifiable temporal origin of acts and data.

Key contributing factors:
- Fragmented temporal sequencing across Member States
- Non-opposable origin of acts
- Ex-post reconstruction of events
- Administrative duplication
- Enforcement delays

When origin is not fixed:
- responsibility shifts from act to procedure,
- disputes increase,
- trust erodes,
- costs compound over time.

This decay is structural, not political.
