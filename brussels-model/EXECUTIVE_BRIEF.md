## Executive Brief — European Commission

The European Union currently lacks a shared technical infrastructure capable of
verifying the temporal origin and integrity of acts prior to their institutional
recognition.

This structural gap generates systemic inefficiencies, delayed enforcement,
legal uncertainty and cumulative economic loss.

Based on conservative cross-sector estimates, the cumulative impact of this
structural deficit reaches approximately €1 trillion over a 10–15 year period.

HERMETICUM is proposed as a minimal, neutral and federable infrastructure to
arrest this decay by restoring verifiable temporal origin without altering
sovereignty or legal competences.
